ALL is a prevalent and life-threatening of cancer that requires accuracte and timely diagnosis for efective treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods for ALL often involves time-consuming and subjective manual examination of blood smears, leading to potential errors and delays in diagnosis. To address these challenges, this project proposes a diagnostic sysytem based on deep learning CNN and streamlit, aimed to achieving fast and accurate classification of ALL.
